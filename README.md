**Odin Recipes Project**
This is my first HTML project with The Odin Project, focused on building a basic recipe website. The aim of this project is to demonstrate my understanding of fundamental HTML concepts and to apply the skills I've learned so far.

The website will include a main index page which links to a few individual recipe pages. While the design will initially be minimalistic and straightforward, the core objective is to construct a well-structured HTML content.

**Skills Demonstrated:**
Use of basic HTML tags for structuring content such as headings, paragraphs, lists, links, and images.
Creating multiple HTML pages and linking them together.
Understanding and applying the best practices for HTML structure and layout.
Utilizing Git and GitHub for version control, including cloning, committing, and pushing changes.
Markdown language proficiency for creating and updating the README.md file.
This project is part of a larger journey to learn web development, and I'll revisit this website in the future to enhance its design with CSS and improve functionality with JavaScript.
